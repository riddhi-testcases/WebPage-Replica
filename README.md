## About the Project

This project aims to replicate the design and functionality of Intervue.ioâ€™s website based on a static mockup. The main goal was to build a **responsive**, **well-structured**, and **visually accurate** front-end layout using semantic HTML and custom CSS.

### Tech Stack

- **HTML5** â€“ for semantic structure  
- **CSS3** â€“ custom styling with responsiveness in mind  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** â€“ minimal interactivity (e.g., input feedback, icons)  
- **Google Fonts** â€“ [Sora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sora) for modern typography  
- **Lucide Icons** â€“ open-source icon library  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ for version control and deployment  

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first** approach
- Adapts seamlessly between devices and screen sizes
- Uses `rem`, `flexbox`, and media queries for layout control

## Features

- Styled header with nav links and buttons
- Responsive hero section with search functionality
- Testimonial/video section with a custom clipped shape and play button
- Newsletter footer with email input and social links
